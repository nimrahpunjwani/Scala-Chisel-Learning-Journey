    //Write a skala program that implements the function y = axÂ² + bx + c
    // where a = 3 b = 5 and
    // c equals to 7
    // create list of integers in the range - 3 lesser than equal to X
    // lesser than equal to 3 and
    // use the defined function to map its payment to another list in the map list
    // and verify the result

    //for y
    val y = a * (x * x) + b * x + c
    //val y2 = a * (x * x) + b * x + c

    //Question 1 part II

    val mappedList = myList.map(x => x)

    //Zip the two lists created in Exercise 1 and
    // then zip the resulting list with its index.
    // A list with three elements per pair is created in the following format: (2, f(x), index).
    // Find the mean value of f(x) and store the respective pair to a variable mean.
    // Refer to Listings 10.11, 10.16 and 10.21 for possible hints.

    //    Write a Scala code that takes in a vector as an integer list
    //    and calculates its Euclidean norm.
    //    Recall that this is also termed as the magnitude of a vector
    //    and is evaluated as given below.
